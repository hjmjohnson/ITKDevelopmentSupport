This is a CMake-powered build system for tools commonly needed for ITK developers, and possibly others.

The only necessary user-configurable parameter is CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX

This defaults to /usr/local

If you don't want these tools in /usr/local, or you don't have permission to do system-wide installs you can specify whatever location works best for you.

An example script is provided: build_for_single_user.sh
